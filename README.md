PROJECT - 1

KEY HIGHLIGHTS 

Data Extraction: Leveraged the GitHub API to retrieve information on high-follower users based in Beijing, focusing on essential user metrics such as follower count, bio, and repository details like star count and language.

Insightful Finding: Notably, while many Beijing-based users have over 100 followers, a significant portion lack repositories with active engagement, with 70% of repos having fewer than five stars.

Strategic Developer Tip: By focusing on more collaborative or innovative repositories, these developers could better capitalize on their follower base and enhance their professional reach in the GitHub community
